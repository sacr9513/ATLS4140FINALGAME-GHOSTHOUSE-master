Update 11/30/2020- Sammie

- Added Levels and Prefab pick ups.
- Constructed Puzzles (still needs more work though) 
- changed camera angles at some points to help with ability to complete level
- Compiled Shaders
- imported assets


NEED TO DO: 
- Enemies
- Flashlight functionality? 
- Camera Orbit???
- Rotating Walls for Third Level Puzzle
- Level Progression- Moving from one level to another as they're completed
- UI
- SOund Effects


MOVEMENT SYSTEM FEATURES AND GOALS:


- WASD keys to move
- Camera follows player character from a third person view
- Jumping
- Simple collisions with built-in Unity physics engine

ISSUES:
- Camera cuts off some of the environment at the bottom of the screen (due to camera angle, will ask Matt about this...)
- Jumping could be iterated and developed more, right now is more simple jumping (not the 'floating' jump)
